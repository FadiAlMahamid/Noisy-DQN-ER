# ===================================================================
# --- The Experience Replay Buffer ---
# ===================================================================
class ReplayBuffer:
    """
    A memory-efficient, fixed-size buffer to store and sample experience tuples.

    Experience Replay breaks the temporal correlation between consecutive
    samples by storing transitions and sampling random mini-batches for
    training. This prevents catastrophic forgetting that occurs when an
    agent only learns from the most recent transition and overwrites
    previously learned behavior.

    Instead of storing full frame-stacked states (which duplicate 3 of 4
    frames between consecutive transitions), this buffer stores individual
    frames and reconstructs stacked states on demand during sampling.
    This reduces memory usage by nearly half compared to a naive approach.

    Each transition is stored as: (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
